## Objectives / Results

Over the course of a little more than a week, we had the opportunity to create the WinxxxBox inspired by the Game Boy. The goal of our project was to develop a Game Boy-like device capable of interacting with others in the vicinity through networks. The project aimed to impart knowledge in 3D modeling and molding, design, as well as expertise in Wifi or BLE communication using ESP32(-C3), and the utilization of an OLED SSD1306 screen.

As implied by the project's name, we embraced the theme of Winx. This concept inspired the features integrated into our WinxxxBox, along with its fairy design (Zach, it's not a gremlin).

### Features
- OLED display
- Wifi communication (using ESP-NOW)
- Sending pre-registered messages
- Changing the color of your Winx
- Tic-tac-toe game

## Modeling / Molding

## Code

We utilized new libraries and services compatible with ESP32 and the OLED SSD1306 screen, as well as the keypad to create matrices differentiating the various buttons used. ESP-NOW proved to be very useful for Wifi communication.

## Project Feedback

We learned a lot from this project due to our task distribution. We decided to enhance our skills by choosing areas where we were less comfortable, with the aim of learning. Despite some challenges and obstacles, it's a successful bet. We are proud of the work done, both in terms of artistic aspects and the implemented features in the WinxxxBox.
